A bridge demo for Polymer

### Team members

### Project Overview
I deployed a bridge contract on both the source chain and the destination chain. When a user sends a token on the source chain, they can receive it on the target chain.
### Run-book
1. Install dependens, compile, deploy
```
just install 
npx hardhat compile
just deploy optimism base
```
2. You will get 2 contract addresses as port address
